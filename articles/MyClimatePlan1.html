<h3 class="mb-3 font-weight-bold">Ask me: What is My Climate Plan?</h3>

<p>The name alone – <i>MyClimatePlan.com</i> – caused me to ask myself:  “Do I have a climate plan?”</p>

<p>I recalled my friend, a doctor, exclaiming, “The flames across the lake were <i>apocalyptic</i>. I was <i>sure</i> we would have to evacuate all patients from Kelowna General Hospital.”  He was planning on the fly. </p>

<p>So, I answered my own question: “I now have a plan.  Step 1 is: ‘To do better planning’.  Step 2 is check out <i>MyClimatePlan.com.</i>”</p>

<p>On reflection, I realized I already had a sketchy plan, on a scale from 1 to 10: </p>

<p> “Live in the moment.  Ignore climate change.”     <-- …………….………….………….………….………….………………………….. -->   “Failing to plan is planning to fail.” </p>
               
      <p>                        1                    2                    3                    4                    5                    6                    7                    8                    9                    10</p>

<p> (Where are you on that scale?) </p>

<p>My climate <b><i>career</i> plan</b> was to shift from 3 to 8 on a scale of climate action.  </p>

<p> <b> Home energy plan</b>?  Bits and pieces.  Not a whole integrated plan. </p>

<p><b> Migration plan</b>?  No.  And sketchy <b> earthquake plan</b>  but no thinking at all about an <b> evacuation plan. </b>  </p>

<p><b> Investment plan</b>?  Yes.  We buy into mutual funds that study and invest in companies that are developing solutions to the climate crisis. </p>

<p><b> Vacation plan? </b>   Usually we have a plan by May.  This year the forest fires changed our <b> camping plan</b>  for August. </p>

<p>Each week, we have <b> grocery shopping plans</b>  and some weeks <b> dinner plans</b>.  We are continuing to shift to foods with lower carbon emissions. </p>

<p><b> Social plans? </b>   We are gravitating towards people who share our awareness of the climate crisis. </p>

<p><b> Health plans? </b>   We walk and bike a lot.   Exercise reduces depression, even climate-related anxiety. </p>

<p><b> Conclusion? </b>   I do have climate plans.  But I want to do better.  Smoky skies, forest fires, floods, droughts and storms are forcing me to think bigger. </p>
 
<p>Step 3 was to join <b> MyClimatePlan.com</b>  and Step 4, seek help <b> planning better</b>  and <b> implementing plans better. </b> </p>
