<h2 class="mb-3 font-weight-bold">International Academics for Collaboration on Travel Equity</h2>
<h5 class="mb-3 font-weight-bold">Applying <i>Implementation Science</i> methods to help universities achieve carbon emission reduction targets</h5>
<p></p>
<p>InterACTE helps you get academic credit for your initiatives on travel equity within your university.  Here are suggested steps, adapted from 
<i>The Behaviour Change Wheel: A Guide to Designing Interventions</i> by Michie S, Atkins L, West R (Silverback Publishing, 2014).</p>
<p>Step 1: Form a group. Agree on what behaviours or policies you want to change.  Submit an abstract.  See example below.</p>
<p>Step 2: Map <i>Capabilities, Opportunities, Motivations and Behviours (COM-B)</i>. Submit a poster. See diagram below.</p>
<p>Step 3: Record audio of a discussion of <i>Behaviour Change Techniques</i> you might use. Submit a podcast.</p>
<p>Step 4: Combine output of Steps 1-3 in a video recorded webinar. Submit it as an invited presentation.</p>
<p>Step 5: Combine output of Steps 1-4 into a manuscript including quotations from transcripts of recordings. Submit it as paper for peer review.</p>
<p>Step 6: Review a submitted paper in our repository.  Submit your review as a commentary for peer review.</p>
<p>We will hold an annual online conference and establish an online journal.</p>

<h3 class="mb-3 font-weight-bold">Engaging academics in climate-conscious travel equity</h3>
<p>Goal:  Implement <i>anonymous</i> annual self-reporting of professional flights by faculty members at University of British Columbia (UBC) Canada.</p>
<p>Background:  UBC's Board of Governors in 2021 adopted a policy to reduce carbon emissions from business travel by half by 2030.</p>
<p>Methods: We developed and tested a Google form that can be completed in one minute, that enables self-reporting of the number of round-trip flights to 20 geographic regions listed in approximate order of distance.  We approached the UBC Faculty Association and requested they survey faculty members on their willingness to complete an anonymous 1-minute form once a year.</p>
<p>Results: Test users reported that the form was very simple.  
Interest in surveying faculty members on policy questions (use of international trips as evidence of academic stature for promotions and merit pay) 
slowed progress on self-reporting of flights.</p>
<p>Impacts: The Faculty Association established a new Committee on Climate Change and Academic Work. </p>
<p>Challenges: Some faculty members anticipate that other faculty members regard flying as part of intellectual academic freedom.</p>
<p>Lessons: <i>Anonymous</i> self-reporting of flights does not need to be very accurate to engage academics in discussing travel equity. </p>

<h3 class="mb-3 font-weight-bold">Meeting Wisely: Reducing low-value care, telecare and travel</h3>
<p>Goal:  Include carbon emissions accounting in policies addressing growth in low-value health care and telecare.</p>
<p>Background:  Policy tools for reducing low-value care in some jurisdictions include patient copayments. The Canada Health Act disallows most copayments but travel costs are effectively patient copayments that inhibit low-value visits to physicians. Telecare reduces such copayments, allowing growth in low-value care.  Yet telecare also reduces carbon emissions and carbon taxes. </p>
<p>Method:  We assessed scenarios for payments for climate harm to be shared in different ways by organizations, care providers and patients. We assumed carbon emissions and carbon taxes are ‘externalities,’ and therefore external to the scope of the Canada Health Act.</p>
<p>Results:  Our health systems account for 10% of CO2-equivalent emissions: 1.6 ton per person annually. At $50/ton, Canada’s carbon tax theoretically could yield $82 per person.  Copayments for emissions from low-value care could be administered cheaply by annual data linkage with provincial pharmaceutical benefit program copayment systems, leading to carbon-based/income-based deductibles.  A politically feasible top-down scenario is for burdens of carbon copayments to be borne first by health system administrators and care providers via travel carbon budgets. Organizations should calculate their ‘flightprints’ using travel reimbursement data.</p>
<p>Impacts:  Measurement leads to engagement, awareness and action. </p>
<p>Challenges: Similar to what Choosing Wisely was invented to address. Specialty conferences should add departure airport codes to online forms for meeting registrations and report flightprints.</p>
<p>Lessons:  Acceleration of telecare and the climate crisis demand new policies for addressing low-value care. Meeting Wisely should be a program within Choosing Wisely. </p>
