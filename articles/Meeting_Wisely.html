<h4 class="mb-4 font-weight-bold">Reducing low-value care, telecare and travel</h4>
<p>Goal:  Include carbon emissions accounting in policies addressing growth in low-value care and telecare.</p>
<p>Background:  Policy tools for reducing low-value care in some jurisdictions include patient copayments. The Canada Health Act disallows most copayments but travel costs are effectively patient copayments that inhibit low-value visits to physicians. Telecare reduces such copayments, allowing growth in low-value care.  Yet telecare also reduces carbon emissions and carbon taxes. </p>
<p>Method:  We assessed scenarios for payments for climate harm to be shared in different ways by organizations, care providers and patients. We assumed carbon emissions and carbon taxes are ‘externalities,’ and therefore external to the scope of the Canada Health Act.</p>
<p>Results:  Our health systems account for 10% of CO2-equivalent emissions: 1.6 ton per person annually. At $50/ton, Canada’s carbon tax theoretically could yield $82 per person.  Copayments for emissions from low-value care could be administered cheaply by annual data linkage with provincial pharmaceutical benefit program copayment systems, leading to carbon-based/income-based deductibles.  A politically feasible top-down scenario is for burdens of carbon copayments to be borne first by health system administrators and care providers via travel carbon budgets. Organizations should calculate their ‘flightprints’ using travel reimbursement data.</p>
<p>Impacts:  Measurement leads to engagement, awareness and action. </p>
<p>Challenges: Similar to what Choosing Wisely was invented to address. Specialty conferences should add departure airport codes to online forms for meeting registrations and report flightprints.</p>
<p>Lessons:  Acceleration of telecare and the climate crisis demand new policies for addressing low-value care. Meeting Wisely should be a program within Choosing Wisely. </p>
