<h3 class="mb-3 font-weight-bold">What are My Climate Plans?</h3>

<p>The name alone -- <i>MyClimatePlan.com</i> -- caused me to ask myself: "Do I have a climate plan?"</p>

<p>I certainly have good intentions. Call it a sketchy plan, on a scale from 1 to 10: </p>

<p> "Live in the moment." - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - "Failing to plan is planning to fail." </p>
               
<p>                        1 - - - - - 2 - - - - - 3 - - - - - 4 - - - - - 5 - - - - - 6 - - - - - 7 - - - - - 8 - - - - - 9 - - - - -10</p>

<p>My climate <b><i>career</i> plan</b> is to shift away from Business as Usual, and move from 3 to 8.  </p>
<p>So, I resolved: "I will <i>now</i> start moving from intentions to specific plans..."</p>  
<p><b>Step 1:</b> 'Reflect on my own climate planning'.</p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b> 'Check out <i>MyClimatePlan.com.</i>'</p>

<p> <b> Home energy plan?</b> Responding to Federal government incentives, my partner and I got a home energy assessment 
and ordered solar panels and a heat pump. 
I spent many hours calculating the energy and future dollar value from placing panels on the east southeast roof unobstructed by trees 
versus a south southwest roof that will be
partially blocked by trees in the winter.</p>
<p> Does that count as a climate plan?</p>
<p><b> Vacation plan? </b> We planned a camping trip to Banff via Kelowna. Forest fires changed our route. </p>

<p>My friend, a doctor, later exclaimed, "The flames across the lake were <i>apocalyptic</i>. 
I was <i>sure</i> we would have to evacuate all patients from Kelowna General Hospital."</p>  
<p>He was planning on the fly while caring for emergency patients. How frightening!

<p><b> Evacuation plan? Migration plan?</b> We have neither.</p>

<p><b> Investment plan?</b>  Yes.  We buy into mutual funds that invest in companies that are developing climate solutions. We could do more of that.</p>

<p><b> Vacation plan? </b>   Usually we have a plan by May.  Forest fires changed our plan this year. </p>

<p><b> Grocery shopping plans? Dinner plans?</b>  We are continuing to shift to foods with lower carbon emissions. </p>

<p><b> Social plans? </b>   We are gravitating towards couples who share our views of the climate crisis. </p>

<p><b> Health plans? </b>   We walk and bike a lot.   Exercise reduces depression and climate anxiety. </p>

<p><b> Education plan? </b> I've taken courses but not decided on a long-term plan for how to be informed without burning out.   </p>

<p><b> Reading plan? </b> I want to avoid compulsive reading of bad news on climate, and read more about solutions.  </p>

<p><b> Neighborhood plan? </b> At a block party on our street, I wore a name tag: "Malcolm.  Ask me about... 'My Climate Plan'. I met a climate activist nurse who is keen to collaborate. </p>

<p><b> Conclusion? </b>   I do have climate plans.  But smoky skies, forest fires, floods, droughts and storms make me want to do better. </p>
 
<p><b>Step 3:</b> I decided to seek help on <b> planning better</b>  and <b> implementing plans better. </b> </p>
<p><b>Step 4:</b> I joined <b> MyClimatePlan.com</b></p> 
<p><b>Step 5:</b> I joined volunteered to form a group that <b>My Climate Plan</b> would give early access to its platform.  
That would help me with some of the challenges of facilitating an action group.</p> 
<p><b>Step 6:</b> When people ask him, "What is the one thing I should do?", climate action leader, Bill McGibben, says "Join a group." </p>
